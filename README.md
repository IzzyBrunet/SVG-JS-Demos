# About Computer Languages

A **computer language** is a method of communication with a computer.

Most commonly discussed categories of computer languages are probably _Markdown_ and _Programming Languages_. However, the list is a bit longer than that. Some people may argue that some of these should be lumped together, others may argue some I've kumped together should be their own category.

Types of Computer Languages:
- ADL
- DQL
- HDL
- Knowledge Representation
- Markup
- Modeling
- Programming
- Specification
- Style
- Transformation


## Markup

Markup languages are those designed to format content. Most notable example is probably _html_.

```markdown
**Example in HTML:**

<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      Hello World HTML Page!
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello World!!
  </body>
</html>
```


## Programming Languages

There are a variety of programming languages, and we're going to go over a few. Some languages are high level, some low level; some compiled, some interpretted.

```markdown
**Example in Ruby:**

PATH = 'hello_world.txt'
File.open(PATH, 'w') { |file| file.puts "Hello world!" }
```
